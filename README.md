# ElmPong

A very simple, and badly implemented Pong game.

#### State
* Two player controls (currently lacking proper bar movement)
* Out of bounds and scoring support
* Keeping count of scores
* Controlling ball direction by hitting bar at top or bottom 

#### Plans
* Better visuals / features
* Speed / vector based player controls
* Synchronize game state between each tick

#### Motivations
1. Learning Elm by writing pong.
2. Becoming better at realizing when and where to apply math for game development.
