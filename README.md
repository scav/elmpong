# ElmPong

A very simple, and badly implemented Pong game.

#### State
* Basic mechanics are in place, but the code and implementation will be improved upon.
* Currently, simple vector subtractions control movement of the ball, the only "free" object.
* The computer is dumb.


#### Motivations
1. Learning Elm by writing pong.
2. Becoming better at realizing when and where to apply math for game development.
